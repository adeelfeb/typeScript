# Understanding Interfaces in TypeScript

In TypeScript, **interfaces** are a powerful way to define the structure of an object. They allow you to specify the types of properties, methods, and their relationships, enabling better type safety and self-documenting code. 

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Basic Interface Definition**
An **interface** is a way to describe the structure of an object, including the types of its properties and methods. It is like a contract that enforces what an object should look like.

```typescript
interface User {
    email: string;
    age: number;
    houseAddress?: string; // Optional property
    readonly dbId: string;  // Read-only property
    getVideoDetails(): string; // Method definition
}
```

### 2. **Optional Properties**
In the example above, `houseAddress` is an **optional property**, which means the object does not have to include this property.

```typescript
houseAddress?: string;
```

### 3. **Read-Only Properties**
A property marked with `readonly` can only be assigned a value once. It cannot be modified after that.

```typescript
readonly dbId: string;
```

### 4. **Methods in Interfaces**
Interfaces can also define methods that the objects must implement. These methods can include parameters and return types.

```typescript
getVideoDetails(): string;
```

### 5. **Extending Interfaces**
Interfaces can be **extended** using the `extends` keyword. This allows you to create a new interface that inherits the properties and methods of an existing interface and then add more properties or override existing ones.

```typescript
interface ExtendedUser extends User {
    phoneNumber: string;
    premiumMember: boolean;
    getFullName(): string;
}
```

In the above example, **`ExtendedUser`** inherits everything from **`User`** and adds additional properties like **`phoneNumber`** and **`premiumMember`**.

### 6. **Using Interfaces with Objects**
Once an interface is defined, you can use it to type-check objects that match the structure of the interface.

```typescript
const Joe: ExtendedUser = {
    email: "joe@domain.com",
    age: 32,
    dbId: "123",
    phoneNumber: "123-456-7890",
    premiumMember: true,
    getFullName: () => "Joe Doe",
    getVideoDetails: () => "Some details about the video",
    getCoupon: () => 5,
};
```

In this case, **`Joe`** is guaranteed to have all the properties and methods defined in the `ExtendedUser` interface, including any additional properties or methods.

### 7. **Why Use Interfaces?**
- **Code Clarity**: They allow you to define and enforce the structure of data clearly.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript will ensure that the objects follow the structure, preventing runtime errors.
- **Extensibility**: Interfaces can be extended, allowing for reusable and scalable code.

### 8. **Conclusion**
Interfaces are a crucial tool for object-oriented programming in TypeScript. They help to enforce consistent structures and improve code maintainability. Whether you're defining the shape of objects or creating more complex types, interfaces provide powerful features to ensure your code is both readable and error-free.
