# TypeScript Error Function and Never Type Example

## Overview
This is a simple example demonstrating how TypeScript handles functions that throw errors. The example also introduces the `never` type, which is used when a function will never return a value (typically due to throwing an error or infinite loops).

## Explanation

### `throwError(message: string): never`
- This function takes a string `message` and throws an error with that message.
- The return type of `never` indicates that this function will not complete its execution normally and will always throw an error.

### `handleError(isError: boolean): void`
- This function takes a boolean `isError`. If `true`, it calls the `throwError` function, which throws an error. If `false`, it simply logs "Everything is fine."
- It demonstrates error handling by using a `try-catch` block.
